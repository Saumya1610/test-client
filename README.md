# 😸 Exploding Kitten 

This will be an online single-player card game that consists of 4 different types of cards

Cat card 😼
Defuse card 🙅‍♂️
Shuffle card 🔀
Exploding kitten card 💣
There will be a button to start the game. When the game is started there will be a deck of 5 cards ordered randomly. Each time user clicks on the deck a card is revealed and that card is removed from the deck. A player wins the game once he draws all 5 cards from the deck and there is no card left to draw.

# Rules –

1. If the card drawn from the deck is a cat card, then the card is removed from the deck.
2. If the card is exploding kitten (bomb) then the player loses the game.
3. If the card is a defusing card, then the card is removed from the deck. This card can be used to defuse one bomb that may come in subsequent cards drawn from the deck.
4. If the card is a shuffle card, then the game is restarted and the deck is filled with 5 cards again.
5. If the player has any card with him other that exploding kitten card or shuffle card after picking 5 cards the player wins
